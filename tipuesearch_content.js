While choosing Software Engineering as my professional career, I am also interested in music (both listening and playing), cinematography, writing and storytelling. I have huge fascination for art, whether it is drawing a cartoon on paper with a ball pen or a ten year long anime, I am all for it. If you are an artist who plays music/likes drawing/do comedy or involve in any creative endeavour, I am already a fan of you and will always root for you! To have light hearted time, I usually watch a podcast/watch some comic videos or sometimes watch a movie or tv series recommended by my friends. Even better if I have some friends with me and couple of beers. As an engineer, I have built applications from scratch which have been catered to PAN India and they are currently helping the law enforcement agencies to maintain law and order in our beloved country. I love writing code in python, whether it be flask/django/pyspark or anything related. I like to imagine myself building AI which will work for the welfare of humankind. While it is mostly daydreaming, There is certain truth to it and if given an opportunity, I am willing to make it happen at all cost.

An adversary could use this attack to poison the host header and further carry out malicious activities on the victim. In Http request-response model, host header is one of the header found in request made by client. Sometimes web servers use this header information to redirect the request to appropriate application running on some port in the server, sometimes web application use this header to create absolute urls added in thier rounting file (such as urls.py file in Django). The issue is, since the host header is sent by client, we can never trust this data to make server side decisions. Two of the most severe attacks an adversary can do are: Password reset poisoning. Web cache poisoning. Other kind of security breaches can also be done on top of this vulnerablity. For an example, an attacker can get the secret token to reset a user's password by passing malicious header. The web application will then create an absolute URL with malicious header which has the secret token and send the password reset link to the real user's mail. If user happens to click on that reset link which is recieved in his/her mail out of nowhere, User will pass that secret token to an attacker controlled host. To mitigate this, there are two kinds of check which we can apply: Whitelist hosts in our web application. Whitelist hosts in our web server conf. (Our nginx server). Some frameworks such as Django provide configuration variable in settings file while in other framworks we have to check the host header before we process any request. In Django, the setting variable is ALLOWED_HOSTS = [] , where we have to provide host names as a list. But more than often, people put an astrix '*' in that list and carry on this to the production. I advice you to put your IP address or domain name or both in that list and then go for production. This will fix the issue at application level and you will be free of this vulnerability. In Flask, We have a decorator named @app.before_request which allows us to manipulate and validate any requests coming to the server. @app . before_request def check_for_maintenance (): if request . host not in [ '10.x.y.z' , 'www.mywebsite.com' ]: return redirect ( url_for ( '_site/403.html' )) if IS_MAINTENANCE_MODE and request . path != url_for ( \"maintenance\" ): return redirect ( url_for ( 'maintenance' )) This is how we handle and fix the issue using flask/django. Now let's discuss how we can block maliciouos headers using our nginx: Open your nginx.conf file (in my case path is /usr/local/conf/nginx.conf ) Add the below code in your server block: server { listen 443 ssl ; ... ... # Deny bad headers if ( $host !~* &#94; ( www.mywebsite.com ) $ ) { return 444 ; } } Voila, you are good to go. Now nginx is not gonna accept any header other than your mentioned whitelisted one. I hope you found this blog helpful, write in the comments if you have any doubts or if you get stuck somewhere.
