var tipuesearch = {"pages":[{"title":"About Me","text":"Hi! My name is Prakhar and welcome to my website. While choosing Software Engineering as my professional career, I am also interested in Music (Both listening and playing), Cinematography, writing and Storytelling. I have huge fascination for art, whether it is drawing a cartoon on paper with a ball pen or a ten year long Anime, I am all for it. If you are an artist who plays music/likes drawing/do comedy or involve in any creative endeavour, I am already a fan of you and will always root for you! To have light hearted time, I usually watch a podcast/watch some comic videos or sometimes watch a movie or tv series recommended by my friends. Even better if I have some friends with me and couple of beers. As an engineer, I have built applications from scratch which have been catered to PAN India and they are currently helping the law enforcement agencies to maintain law and order in our beloved country. I love writing code in python, whether it be flask/django/pyspark or anything related. I like to imagine myself building AI which will work for the welfare of humankind. While it is mostly daydreaming, There is certain truth to it and if given an opportunity, I am willing to make it happen at all cost.
